The application provides a simulated bug-infested codebase where users can identify and resolve various bugs to enhance their debugging skills and understanding of the repository pattern.

## Features

- Simulated bug-infested codebase: The application provides a codebase filled with intentional bugs to be fixed.
- Repository pattern implementation: The codebase follows the repository pattern, allowing users to practice debugging and fixing bugs within this architectural design.
- Interactive console interface: Users can navigate through the application using a user-friendly console interface.
